30 Day Challenge – 30 Sites In 30 Days – #2

Created a portfolio website with some alt pages. I mostly used HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4 and a little jQuery. 
I had to do a lot of researches for this site and It was a really painful one but definitely worth it.
I am so excited to create another awesome website tomorrow. :)
